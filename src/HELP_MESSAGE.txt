The purpose of this application is to implement interpolation of the equations by various methods.

* You can choose function from the list:
   1) y = x^3 - x + 4
   2) y = cos(x)/(x^2 + 1)
   3) y = sin(x)
* You can choose method from the list:
   1) By Lagrange polynomial
   2) By Newton polynomial (Done)
   3) By Cubic Spline
* Also you need to set the bounds of the solution and count of points.
* After point generation you are able to perform interpolation. Also, you can change the `y` coordinate of each point.
* When interpolation is ready you can get the value of function in each point what you want.

Plot legend:
* orange - selected function
* blue - selected points
* green - interpolated function
* red - interpolated function point
